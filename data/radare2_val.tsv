q	a
I want to see all the functions that have a low number of basic blocks that have less than 3 incoming edges. How can I filter for that?	aflj~{}..nbbs?@?.bbinc<3/nbbs>0.6
How can I find all the functions that have a specific type of control flow transfer, like a jump to a location outside the function?	/af~jmp,0x
I want to see all the functions that have a high number of pointer arguments compared to their number of outgoing calls. How can I find them?	aflj~{}..nargs?@?.npargs/ncalls>3
How do I find all the functions that have a call to a specific string length function, like strlen?	afl~sym.imp.strlen
I want to see all the functions that have a low number of instructions that perform flag manipulation operations. How can I filter for that?	aflj~{}..ninstr?@?.(cmc+stc+clc+sti+cli)/ninstr<0.05
How can I find all the functions that have a specific type of basic block, like a block that starts with a non-conditional jump?	aflt~^jmp,
